<p>Many a traveller has inquired of my choice of CiceroBC. &quot;Why?&quot;, they ask. &quot;Because&quot;, I respond. &quot;Huh?&quot;, they continue. I sigh...I pause...<br>
  &quot;Do you know who Cicero was?&quot;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(copied from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero">wikipedia</a>)<br>
  Cicero was born in 106 BC in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpinum" title="Arpinum">Arpinum</a>, a hill town 100 kilometers (62 mi) southeast of Rome. His father was a well-to-do member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrian_(Roman)" title="Equestrian (Roman)">equestrian order</a> with good connections in Rome, though as a semi-invalid, he could not enter public life. He compensated for this by studying extensively. Although little is known about Cicero's mother, Helvia, it was common for the wives of important Roman citizens to be responsible for the management of the household. Cicero's brother <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Tullius_Cicero" title="Quintus Tullius Cicero">Quintus</a>wrote in a letter that she was a thrifty housewife.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-9">[10]</a>
</p>
<p>Cicero's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognomen" title="Cognomen">cognomen</a>, or personal surname, comes from the Latin for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickpea" title="Chickpea">chickpea</a>, <em>cicer</em>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch" title="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero's ancestors who had a cleft in the tip of his nose resembling a chickpea. However, it is more likely that Cicero's ancestors prospered through the cultivation and sale of chickpeas.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-10">[11]</a> Romans often chose down-to-earth personal surnames: the famous family names of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabius" title="Fabius">Fabius</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentulus" title="Lentulus">Lentulus</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piso" title="Piso">Piso</a> come from the Latin names of beans, lentils, and peas. Plutarch writes that Cicero was urged to change this deprecatory name when he entered politics, but refused, saying that he would make <em>Cicero</em> more glorious than <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aemilius_Scaurus_(consul_115_BC)" title="Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)">Scaurus</a></em> ("Swollen-ankled") and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catulus" title="Catulus">Catulus</a></em> ("Puppy").<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-11">[12]</a></p>

<p>During this period in Roman history, to be considered "cultured" meant being able to speak both Latin and Greek. Cicero, like most of his contemporaries,[<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2011">citation needed</span></a></em>] was therefore educated in the teachings of the ancient Greek philosophers, poets and historians. The most prominent teachers of oratory of that time were themselves Greek.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-12">[13]</a> [<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Citation_style" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Citation_style">Full citation needed</span></a></em>] Cicero used his knowledge of Greek to translate many of the theoretical concepts of Greek philosophy into Latin, thus translating Greek philosophical works for a larger audience. It was precisely his broad education that tied him to the traditional Roman elite.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-13">[14]</a></p>
<p>According to Plutarch, Cicero was an extremely talented student, whose learning attracted attention from all over Rome,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-14">[15]</a> affording him the opportunity to study Roman law under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Mucius_Scaevola_Augur" title="Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur">Quintus Mucius Scaevola</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-15">[16]</a> Cicero's fellow students were Gaius Marius Minor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servius_Sulpicius_Rufus" title="Servius Sulpicius Rufus">Servius Sulpicius Rufus</a> (who became a famous lawyer, one of the few whom Cicero considered superior to himself in legal matters), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Pomponius_Atticus" title="Titus Pomponius Atticus">Titus Pomponius</a>. The latter two became Cicero's friends for life, and Pomponius (who later received the nickname "Atticus") would become Cicero's longtime chief emotional support and adviser.</p>
<p>Cicero wanted to pursue a public civil service career along the steps of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursus_honorum" title="Cursus honorum">Cursus honorum</a>. In 90 BC–88 BC, he served both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Pompeius_Strabo" title="Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo">Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla" title="Lucius Cornelius Sulla">Lucius Cornelius Sulla</a> as they campaigned in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_(91%E2%80%9388_BC)" title="Social War (91–88 BC)">Social War</a>, though he had no taste for military life, being an intellectual first and foremost. Cicero started his career as a lawyer around 83-81 BC. His first major case, of which a written record is still extant, was his 80 BC defense of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Roscius" title="Sextus Roscius">Sextus Roscius</a> on the charge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricide" title="Patricide">patricide</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-16">[17]</a> Taking this case was a courageous move for Cicero; patricide was considered an appalling crime, and the people whom Cicero accused of the murder, the most notorious being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Chrysogonus" title="Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus">Chrysogonus</a>, were favorites of Sulla. At this time it would have been easy for Sulla to have the unknown Cicero murdered. Cicero's defense was an indirect challenge to the dictator Sulla, and on the strength of his case, Roscius was acquitted.</p>
<p>In 79 BC, Cicero left for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Minor" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes" title="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, perhaps because of the potential wrath of Sulla.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-17">[18]</a> Cicero traveled to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>, where he again met <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Pomponius_Atticus" title="Titus Pomponius Atticus">Atticus</a>, who had become an honorary citizen of Athens[<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2011">citation needed</span></a></em>] and introduced Cicero to some significant Athenians. In Athens, Cicero visited the sacred sites of the philosophers, but not before he consulted different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric" title="Rhetoric">rhetoricians</a> in order to learn a less physically exhausting style of speech.[<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2011">citation needed</span></a></em>] His chief instructor was the rhetorician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_Molon" title="Apollonius Molon">Apollonius Molon of Rhodes</a>. He instructed Cicero in a more expansive and less intense form of oratory that would define Cicero's individual style in years to come.[<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2011">citation needed</span></a></em>]</p>
<p>Cicero's interest in philosophy figured heavily in his later career and led to him introducing Greek philosophy to Roman culture,[<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs clarification or removal of jargon from October 2011">clarification needed</span></a></em>] creating a philosophical vocabulary in Latin. In 87 BC, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Larissa" title="Philo of Larissa">Philo of Larissa</a>, the head of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy" title="Academy">Academy</a> that was founded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a> about 300 years earlier, arrived in Rome. Cicero, "inspired by an extraordinary zeal for philosophy",<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-18">[19]</a> sat enthusiastically at his feet and absorbed Plato's philosophy. He admired especially Plato's moral and political seriousness, but he also respected his breadth of imagination.[<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2011">citation needed</span></a></em>] Cicero nonetheless rejected Plato's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms" title="Theory of Forms">theory of Ideas</a>.</p>
